# SDML Mode for Emacs

![SDML Logo Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdm-lang/.github/main/profile/horizontal-text.svg)

This package provides an Emacs tree-sitter based major mode for SDML - the
[Simple Domain Modeling Language](https://github.com/sdm-lang/tree-sitter-sdml).

[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/sdml-mode-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/sdml-mode)

## Installing

Install is easiest from MELPA, here's how with `use-package`.

```elisp
(use-package sdml-mode)
```

Or, interactively.

    M-x package-install RET sdml-mode RET

### Install manually

First clone the Git repository to a local path.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdm-lang/emacs-sdml-mode.git
```

The following uses `use-package` but any equivalent package manager should work.
The function `sdml-mode-setup` ensures the installation of the SDML parser with
the core `tree-sitter` package.

```elisp
(use-package sdml-mode
  :load-path "/path/to/repo")
```

### Tree-Sitter Parser

Additionally you will need to manually install the parser at this time. Start by
cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdm-lang/tree-sitter-sdml.git
```

Build just the parser dynamic library, but importantly you need to select a
specific ABI version.

```bash
TS_GENERATE_ABI=13 make build_parser
```

Finally copy the dynamic library to a location in the path specified by the
Emacs variable `tree-sitter-load-path`.

```bash
cp build/libtree-sitter-sdml.dylib ~/.tree-sitter/bin/sdml.dylib
```

## Usage

Once installed the major mode should be used for any file ending in `.sdm` or
`.sdml` with highlighting and indentation support.

### Highlighting

Syntax highlighting is provided by the `tree-sitter-hl-mode` minor mode based on
the configuration in the constant `sdml-mode-tree-sitter-hl-patterns`.

The `sdml-mode` also adds to the `prettify-symbols-alist` list, the set of symbols
is in the custom variable `sdml-prettify-symbols-alist`.

### Indentation

Line indentation is provided by the `tree-sitter-indent-mode` minor mode based on
the configuration in the constant `sdml-mode-folding-definitions`.

Default indentation is two spaces, although this can be overridden by the custom
variable `sdml-mode-indent-offset`.

## Ctags Support

Using [Universal Ctags](https://ctags.io) and the [sdml-ctags](https://github.com/sdm-lang/sdml-ctags) package provides a tagging solution for
SDML source. The `sdml-mode-ctags-mode` will determine if [`company-mode`](https://company-mode.github.io/) installed
and add SDML as a supported tag backend. Additionally, this minor mode provides
a command to re-create the project's tag file. The image below shows company
used as the completion UI for type completion when editing.

Command `sdml-mode-ctags-generate` has the default binding `C-c C-s T`. It uses the
variables `sdml-mode-ctags-command` and `sdml-mode-ctags-output-file-name` to
generate the tag file.

## Tool Commands

A number of the tools provided by the SDML command-line tool are exposed as
Emacs commands. The following image shows two tools in use, the module
dependency tree and the validation tool.

![Tool Commands](./images/emacs-tools.png)

### Dependency Tree

* Command `sdml-mode-current-buffer-dependency-tree` has the default binding `C-c
  C-s t`.
* The command will prompt for the maximum depth of the tree where 0 means
  unbounded. This is a command prefix and can therefore be specified with the
  usual `C-u` binding.
* The resulting tree view can be refreshed using the common binding of `g` and quit
  with `q`.

### Full Validation

* Command `sdml-mode-validate-current-buffer` has the default binding `C-c C-s v`.
* Command `sdml-mode-validate` has the default binding `C-c C-s V`.
* The variable `sdml-mode-validation-level` denotes the level of messages produced
  by the validator, with a default of `warnings`.
* The output uses the standard `compilation-mode` with all the common bindings are
  available.

### Abbreviations and Skeletons

This package creates a new `abbrev-table`, named `sdml-mode-abbrev-table`, which
provides a number of useful skeletons for the following. `abbrev-mode` is enabled
by `sdml-mode` and when typing one of the abbreviations below type space to
expand.

Typing `d t SPC` will prompt for a name and expand into the SDML declaration
`datatype MyName ‚Üê opaque _` where the underscore character represents the new
cursor position.

**Declarations**: `mo`=module, `dt`=datatype, `en`=enum, `ev`=event, `pr`=property,
`st`=structure, `un`=union

**Annotation Properties**: `pal`=skos:altLabel, `pdf`=skos:definition,
`ped`=skos:editorialNote, `ppl`=skos:prefLabel, `pco`=rdfs:comment

**Constraints**: `ci`=informal, `cf`=formal, `all`=universal, `any`=existential

**Datatypes**: `db`=boolean, `dd`=decimal, `df`=double, `dh`=binary, `di`=integer, `sd`=string,
`du`=unsigned

Note that for annotation properties with language string values the skeletons
will add the value of the Emacs variable `locale-language` as the language tag.

### Default Key Bindings

* `C-c C-s d` -- open the tree-sitter debug view
* `C-c C-s q` -- open the tree-sitter query builder
* `C-c C-s t` -- open a dependency tree view for the current buffer
* `C-c C-s v` -- run the validator, on the current buffer, and show the results in
  a compilation window
* `C-c C-s V` -- run the validator, on a specified file, and show the results in
  a compilation window
* `C-c C-s T` -- run u-ctags for the current project

## Add-Ons

* [emacs-sdml-fold](https://github.com/sdm-lang/emacs-sdml-fold) provides code-folding support to collapse and expand
  definitions.
* [emacs-sdml-ispell](https://github.com/sdm-lang/emacs-sdml-ispell) provides *selective* spell checking by only checking selected
  nodes in the tree.
* [emacs-flycheck-sdml](https://github.com/sdm-lang/emacs-flycheck-sdml) provides on-the-fly linting for SDML buffers.
* [emacs-ob-sdml](https://github.com/sdm-lang/emacs-ob-sdml) provides the ability to call the SDML [command-line tool](https://github.com/sdm-lang/rust-sdml) to
  produce diagrams and more.
